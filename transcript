Fulton Missouri in America's heartland in March of 1946 Fulton was a sleepy
0:53
college town of 12,000 people about to face the biggest day in its history only
1:00
six months after the end of World War two one of the true Giants of the 20th century arrived in President Harry
1:07
Truman's home state troma thought be just wonderful he brought the great Winston Churchill out to Missouri to
1:13
make a speech he loved the idea of bringing the Prime Minister to a small
1:20
college in the middle of Missouri that nobody ever heard of just a wonderful
1:27
thing they have not only the crazy United States in town but wented
1:34
Churchill the Lion of England and so everybody was excited it was your the
1:39
atmospheric charge didn't really would but Churchill wasn't there to celebrate
1:44
he had come to sound an alarm from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in
1:52
the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent
1:59
behind that curtain after the war the countries of Eastern Europe had been trapped under Soviet domination I
2:06
remember even feeling kind of indignant that the Russians weren't playing fair weren't being nice Churchill told
2:15
America there was still a tyrants left in Europe the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin Josef Stalin was a real son of a
2:25
[ __ ] there was a real brutality when Stalin heard about Churchill's speech he called it an act of war it was presented
2:33
as the imminent attack over America on
2:38
Russia the United States and the Soviet Union had been allies in World War two
2:44
now they would turn against each other the Cold War would last for more than 40
2:51
years Time magazine publisher Henry Luce had
2:57
predicted that an American century would fall oh the end of World War two and by 1946 the world was beginning to witness
3:05
it while the map of devastated Europe was redrawn at conferences in Yalta and
3:11
Potsdam across the Atlantic America had emerged from the conflicts stronger and
3:16
more prosperous than ever before and yet America would be called on again and in
3:22
that sense Churchill's speech was both a warning and an exhortation if the free
3:28
world needed a protector from the evils of Stalin it would have to be the United
3:33
States of America [Music]
3:47
in the fall of 1945 the Second World War history's greatest armed conflict was
3:53
over America's sons and husbands and fathers were coming home
4:03
I flew to Burbank and my wife met me that was great
4:09
she was beautiful as usual and she had she don't really doesn't wear a
4:16
lot of makeup but she had makeup on it was running down her face
4:24
hours most thrilling exciting time of your whole life food is nothing compares to coming home to your loved works was
4:31
heaven that was him but I was just a kid I was just barely
4:37
twenty I guess when I got out of service there was that whole strangeness of having been so fully committed to the
4:45
war to danger to whatever it was you were doing then suddenly a kind of decompression
4:51
chamber which was filled with uncertainty
4:58
returning veterans had reasons to worry about what peace would bring factories
5:03
that had worked around the clock during the war now had few jobs to offer all
5:10
the GIS were coming home there were no jobs and I found a job for $1 an hour
5:18
refinishing damaged refrigerators from freight yards dirty lousy job but I took
5:25
it even before the war ended the government realized that the transition to civilian life would be difficult in
5:31
1944 Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights it guaranteed vets low-cost mortgages and higher education they what
5:40
that would mean fantastic people go to medical school dental school do anything
5:46
they wanted paid for by the government it paid me to study the history of
5:51
English poetry at Harvard of all things just the way it paid somebody else to study a very practical and utilitarian
5:57
subject in South Dakota it was absolutely Democratic and indiscriminate in the highest sense
6:07
veterans would after a brief lull be swept into an American economy Richie an
6:12
unprecedented productivity and opportunity we were the arsenal of democracy all you
6:19
had to do was throw a switch and go from producing the tanks and airplanes and GT
6:25
cars and refrigerators by 4748 the economy was zooming the driving force
6:32
behind the booming economy was the American consumer there hadn't been much to buy during the war Americans had
6:39
built up their savings and now if they were ready to spend we had gathered this
6:45
phenomenal strength that we didn't know we had and we were living twice as well
6:51
everybody was wages productivity everything had just increased in a way
6:57
that no one had ever experienced the newly vibrant economy and the need for veterans housing would inspire one
7:04
entrepreneur to transform thousands of acres of new york potato fields into a
7:09
new kind of American community in the United States is entitled to decent
7:16
shelter Navy veteran bill Levin imagined thousands of homes here and he devised a
7:23
way to build them fast Levinson geniusness that he understands that you
7:28
bring the assembly line to the location that you flatten the potato field you
7:33
mark it off and income the team's slab man tile men window men painting guys
7:40
and they could do I think 18 houses in
7:46
the morning 18 in the afternoon a hundred and eighty a week and $8,000 you
7:52
could buy a great house it was an amazing thing and for the first time he had this whole society moving into the
7:58
middle class the Levitt approach spread across the country making life in the
8:05
suburbs affordable for millions we got our first house a very small 700
8:13
square foot but we were thrilled with it 2-bedroom 1-bath home
8:18
good night it was wonderful [Music]
8:32
my recollection of those years is sunshine and flowers and blue water and
8:39
mountains and the place where you could do almost anything you wanted no matter what I think we I think we were in the
8:46
middle of the endless promise it was
8:51
quite wonderful we started our family in 1950 and it was just a time when we were
9:01
young and everything was before us this sense of limitless optimism led to the
9:08
most dramatic Democratic Change in American history the baby boom between 1946 and 1952
9:16
American families added 25 million children to the population was a great
9:26
white males but for for women I think there was really a very narrow
9:33
conception of what women were made for they were turned into breeders women had
9:38
it tougher gave up their careers for their husbands in order to stay home and have babies I was raising kids and I was
9:47
married to a Marxist and I was married to a fascist and neither one of them ever took out the garbage so that it was
9:55
a step back for women I guess you'd have to say and it wasn't much of a step forward for blacks either nearly a
10:03
million black Americans had fought for their country in World War two they returned home to an America that
10:08
continued to discriminate against them they had been to Europe where they were
10:14
regarded as heroes so to come back to the south still
10:22
haven't go to the back of the bus not being able to sit downstairs in the movie theater it was an ironic kind of
10:32
return to a country for which we had risked our lives President Truman was so
10:40
angry about the treatment of black veterans that he demanded change he said
10:45
a civil rights message to Congress which was the first civil rights message ever sent to Congress by any president and
10:51
he'd made the decision made the decision to order the desegregation of the Armed
10:57
Forces and of the federal government very important something else very
11:03
important America's national sport was changed in the late 1940s in 1947 Jackie
11:10
Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers the first Lac man to play in Major League Baseball
11:17
huge moment and particularly because baseball baseball really mattered them
11:24
from the saw a black ballplayer the only one step out onto the field our hearts
11:33
were with him because we wanted him to succeed they'd call him all kinds of names than they get that stuff trying to
11:40
rattle him but Jackie kept kept us cool
11:46
at the end of his rookie year Jackie Robinson in one national poll was voted
11:52
the second most popular man in America behind only Bing Crosby we're talking
11:58
about the American Dreams best years of our lives you know we want American
12:03
democracy to work at Harry kamas and he's a very intelligent proud person and
12:08
he does brilliantly so in America the years right after the war were a time of
12:14
broken boundaries and seemingly limitless possibilities
12:19
[Music]
12:33
I think the period from 1946 till the early 50s was the greatest time ever it
12:43
was like this country was being reborn in many ways so many new developments were coming along
12:48
[Music] we felt pretty good about the good old
12:53
classic then although there were things happening all over the world that were threatening we were after all number one
13:05
[Music]
13:12
[Music]
13:21
Churchill said that after the war that the United States commands the world the
13:28
strides the world oh but I think he said I think we felt that you were so proud
13:35
and being an American was the best thing in the world and boy nobody could get us
13:41
we could always look the bad guys that kind of faith that kind of belief that
13:48
kind of security was so special in much
13:55
of the world America was special and essential to the future of those
14:01
countries devastated by war
14:07
Europe had waged suicidal war upon itself there was England and it was a
14:13
victor but it was exhausted France was a victor but it was humiliated
14:21
Soviet Union was a victor but it had lost 20 million people the magnitude of
14:27
Soviet losses would leave that nation determined never to be so vulnerable again for ordinary people it was
14:37
tremendous tragedy because in every Russian family there was somebody killed
14:44
at the front
14:49
officers and soldiers returned to burned-out villages people began to dug
15:00
up inside the earth little holes like foxholes and the whole family sometimes
15:08
of six lived in this earth house in the
15:17
two aggressor nations which had begun the war the future looked extremely uncertain Germany was defeated and it
15:25
was going to be cut right in half and Japan had been just as in Churchill's phrase ground powder and in that we'd
15:34
been brought kicking and screaming to the zenith of our power [Music]
15:43
with troops now stationed in 20 countries around the world America's historic isolationism was over
15:50
[Music]
16:04
400,000 GIS were sent to occupy Japan they were under the command of General
16:10
Douglas MacArthur one of the architects of the Japanese defeat the Japanese were
16:15
allowed to keep their emperor hirohito but absolute imperial rule was over the
16:21
United States wrote a new Japanese Constitution in Japan America was the
16:28
sole occupying force in Europe it was America and the Soviet Union and this
16:35
ideological struggle between them would be played out on a continent beset by chaos I made my way eventually through
16:46
Mannheim where I was born and as I made my way through Germany I realized the
16:52
total destruction that had taken place in that country displaced persons
16:59
walking all over from the east to the west from the rest of the East large
17:05
cities bombed out ruins
17:10
in the homeland of the once powerful and terrifying Third Reich people now
17:16
battled one another on the streets for bread there was absolutely nothing to eat so
17:23
they rummaged in garbage cans if I think of my father
17:28
rummaging in garbage cans as saira 'but people without jobs people without homes
17:36
children without parents it was a nightmare it was hideous and one of the
17:44
coldest winters on record came down in Europe [Music]
17:55
there are a lot of children who didn't have any any Christmas we had a big
18:02
Christmas party for
18:08
I played Santa Claus I remember bringing those little kids up seeing him or my laughing and the happy faces and the
18:15
smiles very rewarding
18:20
the only real force was the allied military government that was the power
18:28
the country had come to a standstill
18:33
there was total anarchy in this country
18:38
and throughout Western Europe deprivation and devastation were causing political turmoil in America that was
18:45
concerned that this chaos would somehow encourage Western Europeans to turn to the Communists and it seemed as though
18:53
in a way they had a lot of the cards forever there was misery and poverty
18:58
where could people turn but to communism capitalism don't forget hadn't looked
19:05
too good in the thirties of other people that thought it was played out there was
19:13
a sense that Italy might topple the next election even France there was a
19:18
definite momentum it seemed to me in favor of the Red Menace the political
19:25
leadership in the United States for its part saw the wisdom and getting Europe back on its feet in an act of
19:31
unprecedented generosity America sent thirteen billion dollars in aid the
19:37
United States is the only country in the world today which has the economic power and productivity needed the Marshall
19:48
Plan named after the Secretary of State seemed the perfect merger of American ideals and good politics
19:56
America was a strong generous country in
20:01
his fashionable to make fun of it but it really was true and we were rich and we were confident and we were as
20:08
sympathetic to the devastation of Europe and what we could do
20:16
the Russians were very very harsh where we were sending in stuff to to Western
20:24
Europe they were stripping down Eastern Europe and mailing it railroading
20:29
everything back east as the Soviets tightened their hold on the captive
20:36
nations of Eastern Europe those who could escape did Alice Sylvester and her
20:41
family had survived the Nazi death camps and made their way home to Czechoslovakia there was a Russian
20:50
doctor and he said my child I love my country but the Russians are going to
20:58
overtake here so my advice to you is go run so my mother and I during the night
21:07
when we do their own station got on a train and we got out and the
21:14
next morning they closed the borders so the people that stayed couldn't get out
21:23
Churchill had been right those people now trapped behind the Iron Curtain
21:28
would be subject to Soviet exploitation and repression for the next four decades
21:43
Berlin had lived through a nightmare and at the end of World War two the landscape reflected
21:55
the fighting here had been particularly vicious on the Eastern Front the Germans had fought to the bitter end the Soviet
22:02
Army had suffered half a million casualties before the German capital failed the Russian soldiers they were
22:10
intoxicated by blood by cruelty and it
22:15
was with the memories of what Germans did to their mothers and sisters and
22:20
daughters they wanted to do the scene there was huge loot burning down of
22:27
houses rape Soviet troops raped
22:32
thousands of women my mother was raped gang-raped by the
22:41
Russians and my friend she was raped her
22:46
father was still alive they put him in a corner and said you stand there and you count the rapes on your daughter so all
22:53
the 32 Russians raped her and the father
23:01
had to count out loud 1 2 and so forth that's why I know it was 32
23:10
the Russians were very brutal the Germans they sure hated a Russian
23:16
stone and had a reason the Russians behaved himself miserably here several months late here the
23:24
Western Allies arrived one of the first US missions into post-war Berlin was flown by Jack old and Bennett so he
23:33
landed and then the Russians started to lob shells over my head
23:38
shooting the windows out of the airport with artillery shells why the hell of
23:44
the Russians shooting the windows out of this magnificent Airport then I thought this is the going to be the American
23:49
sector and they don't want to leave the Americans anything located deep inside
23:54
what was now soviet-controlled East Germany Berlin would be divided into Soviet American British and French
24:00
sectors Stalin resented this democratic outpost in Eastern Europe this was
24:07
intended as his buffer zone against any future attack from the West
24:12
Stalin presented his image of the countries on the other side of the Iron
24:20
Curtain this countries want to subjugate Russia with its man's mineral wealth
24:26
their natural enemies of the socialist and communist state
24:33
the first face-to-face confrontation of the Cold War was in Berlin Stalin was
24:40
determined that the Western ally should leave and in June of 1948 he cut all the
24:46
supply lines into the allied sectors it was very tense and we knew that and it
24:52
got tenser and tenser West Berliners had enough food to last a few weeks enough
24:58
fuel to last only days Truman said in
25:04
meetings in the Oval Office and he met it we stayed in Berlin
25:14
you live with the expectation I did that we would be going to war with Russia the
25:23
United States were painted and depicted by official propaganda as the greatest
25:29
enemy ready at any hour to draw atomic bomb on
25:34
Russia we were close to a third world war there were some who were arguing we
25:41
should leave isn't worth it get out why started a third world war over this city
25:47
others were saying we should send an Armored Division through and break through by force
25:54
President Truman chose another option he would supply the beleaguered city by air
26:00
it was a gamble American and British
26:05
pilots who had once dropped bombs on this city would deliver supplies to Berlin hour after hour day after day we
26:14
were so busy during the airlift I was flying a hundred twenty-eight hours a month it's a lot of flying and
26:19
we were keeping people alive they flew in food and fuel and medicine
26:25
they were the lifeline for two and a half million Berliners after 11 months
26:33
Stalin conceded without saying a word he ended the blockade in May of 1949
26:42
three months later Stalin would shock the West again
26:52
[Music]
27:04
once we knew the Soviets had the atomic bomb in 1949 it then became once again a
27:10
different world now we could be a target
27:16
of an atomic attack and did not trust the Russians and I do remember this that
27:25
you always lived you lived day to day with the thought that there could be a nuclear attack on
27:32
us at any time in only three years Americans had gone from buying their
27:38
first homes to building their first bomb shelters I physically dug out an area
27:46
underneath that house right at six foot deep so that the family could at least go there and be below ground level
27:58
the United States would suffer another shock win on October the 1st 1949 they
28:04
learned that Mao Zedong's communists had defeated the american-backed nationalist
28:09
forces in China the Communists under Mao
28:14
touch something very independently thought a brilliant sight you have the
28:23
Russians getting the atomic weapon china has fallen there's no doubt that there
28:32
was a sense in many quarters that we were in a titanic struggle
28:40
the struggle erupted on June the 25th 1950 when North Korea supported by both
28:46
the Soviet Union and China attacked the south an american-led army under the
28:52
auspices of a newly formed United Nations was rushed in to resist them
28:57
three nations have now made it clear that lawless aggression will be met with
29:03
force so once again a wartime draft interrupted American lives men were torn
29:11
from their families and sent to the other side of the world [Music]
29:23
world war two vet land Maffeo Lee had been enjoying the Sun Bay California good life by November of 1950 he was
29:31
fighting North Korean and Communist Chinese soldiers at Korea's Joseon reservoir the Chinese were all over us
29:42
we just moved him down and it was just hard to believe that they would just
29:48
keep coming like that and we had an awful lot of dead and dying it dropped
29:55
between 20 and 40 degrees below zero at times it got so cold the treads tank
30:00
treads froze to the ground I don't think anyone bled to death the blood froze as
30:06
soon as it hit the surface we strictly weren't prepared for that bitter a
30:12
winter here we were just out of a war about five years and we're starting over
30:18
again in another one blew all my marine missions in support of the troops a close air support along
30:25
the front lines napalm close support with bombs rockets [Music]
30:31
in three years time we lost fifty three thousand Americans out there
30:38
was called a police action of course but it was for those involved it was a bloody bloody war the fighting in the
30:50
Korean War was as ferocious as any scene in World War two but when the veterans came home the reception they got was
30:57
quite different in Korea went for 12 or
31:03
13 months and at the end of your tour you were sent home there were no bands
31:11
to meet him no parades or anything like this the way the American people treated
31:20
the Korean War and the returning veterans I think it could be termed the Forgotten War
31:28
I think most Americans did not see the Korean War as a personal threat to themselves and their families would it
31:36
affect the person in the Midwest someplace in their home and their children no it probably would have very little impact on them so I don't think
31:43
most Americans saw it as as being as important as as World War two it's
31:48
certainly been so they didn't pay that much attention to it but Americans were forced to pay attention to a communist
31:55
scare closer to home in 1950 the fear that communists were somehow undermining
32:01
America from within began to gain ground when Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were
32:07
arrested for passing atomic secrets to the Soviets it made it much easier for an obscure senator from Wisconsin to
32:14
make some frightening allegations doeseth McCarthy claimed that communists
32:21
had infiltrated the highest levels of government McCarthy on the rise claiming
32:36
that there were spies everywhere communists everywhere and of course it turns out there were spies everywhere
32:42
they were stealing tommy secrets there was fear there was uncertainty
32:48
insecurity images of communists as evil and threatening were everywhere the most
32:55
successful popular writer of that era and I mean astonishingly popular was a
33:01
writer named Mickey Spillane and he had started out with sort of traditional police detective short punchy
33:08
hemingway-esque sentences tough guys the bullets made little Perry's where they
33:13
went in and turned him to commas as the blood will about I looked at her she was taking off her
33:21
clothes Oh Mike I really want you she walked toward me her hips waving a happy
33:28
hallo and was the coming of the Red Scare he switched it over to knocking out commie heels I looked at him and I
33:36
could tell he was a rotten commie heel whenever the public was you're playing up their appetite but what you try to do
33:43
is establish that appetite for it and then you supply it he hid the virus the vibe that virus and put it right into
33:50
his books which was a very good litmus paper of how much at work and how
33:55
nervous the country was know where was the fear more damaging
34:02
than in Hollywood [Music]
34:16
we went to the movies all the time everybody did and we we got a lot of
34:24
what we felt about our country and about right and wrong and being a good
34:32
American or being honest or courageous from the movies with so much publicity
34:39
about America's Dream Factory coming under the influence of communist agents the House Committee on on American
34:44
Activities had a target are you a member of the Communist Party or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party but
34:53
I have 200 zuv witnesses were called to
35:14
testify on communist influence in Hollywood they were asked not only to account for their own political
35:19
activities but to inform on their friends
35:25
there was scary it was very very scary and I was 19 and I took the fifth in
35:34
front of the committee being an informer and placing your fellow actor fellow
35:43
friend fellow director in jeopardy meant that that family didn't work anymore so
35:50
that taking that step was about the worst thing that you could do to anybody
35:56
the studio's kept lists of so-called political undesirables and refused to
36:01
hire them they had the blacklist the grey list the if list the maybe list the
36:08
they know who list I mean it was it was unbelievable at the height of the Red
36:17
Scare a rumor on the street sort of mentioned in the gossip columns could close down a career lives were warned
36:23
people were driven to suicide people were driven out of the country I think
36:29
the results in this town were really devastating Lee grant won an Oscar nomination in 1951 but then after
36:36
speaking out at a funeral of a friend who she said had been hounded she was blacklisted I mean I remember you know
36:43
like the the floor just rushing out from under me and my heart going dancing that's it you know that's it
36:52
his grant didn't work in Hollywood again for 14 years Army veteran carl reiner was working on
36:59
broadway somebody actually came to my house an FBI guy and said you know if
37:05
there are any communists in the in show business and I said oh there must be there must be lots of them because
37:11
they're all over the place did you know the eyes and all I said you guys the FBI you find him you know I don't know
37:16
they're not gonna tell me I mean I was being funny but I was also scared shitless I am NOT a communist and never
37:24
have been a communist between 1947 and 1950 - the loyalty of three million
37:31
Americans was investigated by the FBI
37:39
people from all walks of life were called before congressional committees baseball heroes union leaders
37:45
schoolteachers diplomats in an
37:53
atmosphere of suspicion the Cold War said Americans against Americans on the
37:59
Battlefront it was frustrating and confusing because it asked the military not to defeat the enemy but to contain
38:05
him the concept of total victory was now overshadowed by the specter of nuclear
38:10
annihilation for Americans so accustomed to the clarity of goals in world war two
38:16
this kind of war was rather baffling by
38:23
1951 the war in Korea had become a bloody stalemate the commander of the UN forces the
38:30
imperious World War two hero General Douglas MacArthur virtually demanded a
38:35
free hand to go after the Chinese MacArthur's supposed to have wanted to
38:42
